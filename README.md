### Hello 👋

I'm Nathan, currently transitioning into web development from video editoring and live AV tech.  
I recently went through Launchcode's web-development program, a non-profit bootcamp based in St. Louis, MO.  
I learned a little bit of Java in college, but I was young and thought journalism was a great career choice.

### A little more about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a capstone project for the career prep section of Launchcode.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Security for said project!
- 🤔 I’m looking for any help, advice, or leads transitioning into full time work.
- 💬 Ask me about art movies, local day hikes, or video compression...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've worked at REI for a couple years now. I love hiking and camping and will always be up to chat about it! If you want recommendations on day hikes around STL, I have you covered!
